### quick_fbx_exporter

This is a fork for implementing FBX export function with adapting shape keys.

**Currently under construction.**

Original code is from the FBX importer/exporter `io_scene_fbx` bundled in Blender 2.79, which is developed by Campbell Barton, Bastien Montagne and Jens Restemeier. Original code's license is GNU General Public License (GPL).
